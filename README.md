QuickList

•	User can create a new list with a unique ID, or load an existing list by entering its ID. The list items can be quickly added, deleted, changed, and saved to the cloud.
•	The front-end is designed with React.js and Bootstrap and is scalable for device screen size. 
•	The back-end is powered by Express and Node.js to connect the web page to a MongoDB collection via a RESTful API with Mongoose.
